# Teams App Localization Node.js
This sample illustrates how to implement [Localization for Microsoft Teams apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/apps-localization).

## Interaction with app
![image](Images/appLocalizationModule.gif)

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft Teams is installed and you have an account (not a guest account)
- To test locally, [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) must be installed on your development machine (version 16.14.2  or higher)
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) or equivalent tunneling solution
- [M365 developer account](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/build-and-test/prepare-your-o365-tenant) or access to a Teams account with the 
   appropriate permissions to install an app.

## Setup

1. Register a new application in the [Azure Active Directory â€“ App Registrations](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2083908) portal.

2. Setup for Bot
	
	- Also, register a bot with Azure Bot Service, following the instructions [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-service-quickstart-               registration?view=azure-bot-service-3.0).
	- Ensure that you've [enabled the Teams Channel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/channel-connect-teams?view=azure-bot-service-4.0)
	- While registering the bot, use `https://<your_ngrok_url>/api/messages` as the messaging endpoint.

    > NOTE: When you create your app registration, you will create an App ID and App password - make sure you keep these for later.

3. Setup NGROK
      - Run ngrok - point to port 3978

	```bash
	  ngrok http -host-header=rewrite 3978
	```   
4. Setup for code

   - Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples.git
    ```

 - In a terminal, navigate to `samples\app-localization\nodejs`

    ```bash
    cd samples/app-localization/nodejs
    ```

 - Install modules

    ```bash
    npm install

5. Update the `.env` configuration for the bot to use the `MicrosoftAppId` and `MicrosoftAppPassword`, `BaseUrl` with application base url. For e.g., your ngrok url. (Note the MicrosoftAppId is the AppId created in step 1 (Setup for Bot), the MicrosoftAppPassword is referred to as the "client secret" in step 1 (Setup for Bot) and you can always create a new client secret anytime.)

6. Setup Manifest for Teams

- **This step is specific to Teams.**
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` contained in the `appPackage/` folder to replace with your MicrosoftAppId (that was created in step1.1 and is the same value of MicrosoftAppId in `.env` file) *everywhere* you see the place holder string `{MicrosoftAppId}` (depending on the scenario the Microsoft App Id may occur multiple times in the `manifest.json`)
    - **Edit** the `manifest.json` for `validDomains` and replace `{{domain-name}}` with base Url of your domain. E.g. if you are using ngrok it would be `https://1234.ngrok.io` then your domain-name will be `1234.ngrok.io`.
    - Zip up the contents of the `appPackage/` folder to create a `manifest.zip`
    - Upload the `manifest.zip` to Teams (in the left-bottom *Apps* view, click "Upload a custom app")

7. Run your app.
- Start the bot

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```


## Interacting with the app in Teams
In Teams, Once the app is successfully installed, you can interact with tab and bot in your preferred language.

#### To change language in Teams
To change the language in Microsoft Teams, please click your profile picture at the top of the app, then select Settings -> General and go to the Language section. Choose the preferred language and restart to apply the change. This sample supports en-US, fr-CA, hi-IN and es-MX.

## Running the sample

1. **Installation**: You should see your app installation screen content in selected language.

2. **Bot**: send any message to see localized

#### To Add more languages for localization in Teams through Code.
 
 Add Resource files for the respective languages, Check culture fallback behaviour and how to add other cultures refer [Globalization and localization Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/localization?view=aspnetcore-5.0).
